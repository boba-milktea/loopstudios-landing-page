## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

It's my first landing page built with CSS Grid. It wans't straight forward, espcially when it has to be responsive. So I have learned the following are quite useful: 


```css
minmax()

.menu-button::before,
.menu-button,
.menu-button::after {
    position: absolute;
    display: block;

}

linear-gradient()

```

### Continued development

It took me a while to understand how to utilise the linear gradient; also how to position it. It can be interesting to develop a dynamic image gallery with linear gradient.
